All right, so in this demo and exercise series, you will learn how to save your work. You've got a bunch of beautiful visualizations, a dashboard, a story in this workbook, and we want to save it so it can live on.

We're working in Tableau Public, as you can see in the top left corner of the screen, and this workbook is currently called Book One. In Tableau Public, again the free version of the software, we can save to Tableau Public only. This is the only saving option presented to us. If we click this button, this will save our entire workbook to the Internet on our Tableau profile. First, after clicking this button it would ask us to log into our profile if we're not logged in, and then it would ask you to save and it would save to the Internet.

In Tableau Desktop, which is not the version of the software we're using right now, the option is to save your workbook locally, or to save a packaged workbook locally with the data, or to save a bookmark which would save a single sheet onto your computer in a folder like this one, Workbooks for example. In Tableau Desktop that is possible, but not in Tableau Public. That said, Tableau public is still a great tool as you can still access and create the same visualizations as you can in Tableau Desktop.
