There are also other options to enhance this chart. Let’s first remove the reference line. You can do this by clicking the line and then, Remove. Imagine we want to know if over the past five years there was an upward or downward trend in the number of deaths. It’s kind of hard to see based on this visualization. Let’s add a trend line. Once again, navigate to the Analytics pane. Under Model you’ll see Trend Line. Drag it to the view and select linear. Don’t worry about the different models. For now, we will just stick with the linear one. There we go. Now you can see that overall there seems to be an upward trend in the number of deaths. There is another cool thing that you can do in Tableau. Imagine you want to have an estimate of the number of deaths next year. Tableau’s built-in analytics make visualizing this really easy. Let’s first remove the trend line. In the Analytics Pane you’ll see Forecast. You can drag it to the view and drop it on the forecast box. Now you can see the forecasted number of deaths for 2019. Cool right? Over to you, let’s tweak your line chart from before.
