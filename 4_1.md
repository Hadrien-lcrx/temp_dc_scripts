OK, so in this demo and exercise series, you're going to learn two of our five dataviz best practices for this course. One, using color purposefully, and two, using readable fonts. We'll do it in the context of this Facebook price and Facebook shares vs day of date combined line and area plot. So we've got Facebook price here in the line plot, and Facebook shares on the area plot here. One hundred shares we owned, then we owned two hundred shares, then we owned three hundred shares.

Cool. So, using color purposefully. Tableau makes it easy to change color. We go to Marks, we click color, we can change it to orange for example. However, using color purposefully means we probably don't want to change it to orange here. So, color purposefully means for example using color or changing color to highlight a key finding in a plot. There really isn't a key finding in this plot, so we're not going do this here.

It can also mean associating a color with a brand for example, and we'll keep the color here blue as Facebook's brand color is blue.

It also means in general limiting colors as too much color is often distracting. There's a whole lot more on color theory for future dataviz best practices courses, so let's move on for now.

The second best practice: use readable fonts. The fonts in the Tableau typeface were designed to be paired with dataviz, and they are optimized for readability, even at small sizes, specifically online. So what makes it readable?

The Tableau font which we'll look at here if we click Format, Workbook, it's called Tableau Book. The Tableau font is a sans-serif font, which experts and users agree make it easier to read online.

Since Tableau uses this font by default, you often won't change it, but if you were to, you can do that. So we'd got to Format, Format workbook for example because we want to format from largest to smallest, largest being Workbook, click Tableau Book here, and in the drop-down we can change it to something like Verdana, which is also a sans-serif font and readable online.
