OK, so we've got our basic dashboard here. Now you'll learn how to customize that dashboard to make it look better and make it more usable. One way of customizing your dashboard is by adding an Object to it, and there's a whole section dedicated to objects here in the dashboard user interface below this Sheets section here. So we're going to add something called a Text Object. We'll drag over a Text Object and as you can see there's that gray area indicating where it's gonna go. We want to add it directly to the top of the plot. We'll make this title of our dashboard, again, titles are often the most memorable thing for readers in your visualization, we'll call this my portfolio. Yes, great. And we'll resize that so there's less whitespace, nice, and then we'll resize our plots so they're a little bit more square. Cool. So, these titles of the individual stock plots here have become a little redundant with this dashboard title. So if we were only going to show our users this dashboard, we can directly, in this dashboard, edit the titles of the plots, removing "My investment in" for example. And because the data in dashboards and worksheets is connected, it's actually propagated to the worksheet here as you can see. Cool. So, we just added something called a tiled Text box. Let's add a floating, as you can see in this Objects section here, we can distinguish between tiled objects and floating objects, and we will drag over a floating image object, to correspond to the currency of the Facebook stock. So we'll add the US flag, and we'll resize that floating image object, as you can see it floats over the individual parts of the dashboard, and there we go.
