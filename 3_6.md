We know that our data is much more granular than that. There’s data down to the month-level. Let’s explore how we can get down to that level of granularity. We can click on the arrow next to YEAR(Date) to make a dropdown menu appear. You’ll see that there are two sections that are responsible for time. There’s this section which has year, quarter, month, day and there’s this section which also has these values. So what’s the difference? Let’s first click on month in the first section. Now we no longer have years at the bottom but months. There's only one January, one February and so on though, while there are multiple years in our data. In our case, that doesn’t make sense since we’re interested in the evolution over time. What is happening is that Tableau considers month as a dimension, meaning a discrete value, and aggregates the number of births for every month. You can see this by the blue color. So how do we get to a timeline at the bottom? Let’s go to the dropdown menu and select the second month. Now, month is recognized as a measure, meaning a continuous value. Notice that it has turned green. This is what we wanted. We can see values for each month in each year. So pay attention when selecting the granularity level for dates. The first section makes it discreet, the second continuous. Over to you!
