Once again we are connected to the Gapminder Health data and this time we want to know which European country had the biggest percentage increase in liver cancer cases over the 3-year period from 2006 to 2008. Let’s start by building a highlight table. To do this we need to drag Year from dimensions to the Columns shelf and Country from dimensions to the Rows shelf. That’s a big table, let’s apply the necessary filters. We will drag Continent to the Filters shelve and select only Europe. We do the same for Year and select 2006, 2007 and 2008. That’s better. Next, let’s fill in the values in the table. We can do this by dragging Liver Cancer from Measures to Text on the Marks card. You’ll see that the default aggregation is sum but in our case that makes sense so we won’t change this. The next step is to color the cell background based on these values. To do this we will drag Liver Cancer to Color on the Marks card. You can see that by doing this the font color of the values was changed. To apply the coloring to the background instead we click the Mark Type drop-down and select Square. There we go. This makes it really easy to spot extreme values. The darker the color, the higher the liver cancer cases diagnosed in that country. Here we can see that during the three-year period Italy consistently had the highest number of cases. Highlight tables are a handy visualization tool, let’s see if you can make one.
