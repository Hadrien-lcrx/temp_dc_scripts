All right, now you'll learn how to create a dashboard. To create that dashboard, we'll combine our four worksheets: Facebook, Tesco, TD Bank, Toyota, each with stock price, stock shares and the date, into one easy to access dashboard, where we can view our entire portfolio at once. So to do that, Tableau has a little button here at the bottom, you hover over it, it's next to the New Worksheet button, it's called New Dashboard, indicated with a little two by two grid here, and we'll create that actual two by two grid here with our four sheets. As you can see here, we've got an empty dashboard with a call to action in the middle: "Drop sheets here". So we'll do that from our Sheets panel here. Drag over Facebook, drag over Tesco next to it, drag TD Bank in the bottom left corner, and as you can Tableau has little highlighted gray areas area indicating where the sheet will be dropped, and we'll do Tesco on the bottom right corner. And now we have a single dashboard with all our of our stock information viewable at once.
