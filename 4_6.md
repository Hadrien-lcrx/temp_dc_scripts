All right, in this demo and exercise series, you'll learn how to customize your story. So we've got our basic story here, four story points (one for each of the stocks), as well as a story point for currency and a story point for value of your portfolio in US dollars.

So, first thing you want to do to customize a story to make it more usable and interpretable from a user's point of view, we will rename it by right clicking the tab at the bottom. We'll call this "My investing journey". It's a little more conversational, a little more storytelling-y.

Great first step. Now let's leverage the power of captions. So, a caption can be a great addition to your story if you want to highlight a specific part of your story essentially. So for Facebook's story point, we may want to say that we bought relatively low here, we bought shortly after Facebook bottomed out, so we'll say "Bought shares" from a hundred, sorry from two hundred to three hundred, and we will say, "I bought low on Facebook", and that's a neat finding for our story. This could be in the context of a presentation, and we would talk a little bit more about how we bought on Facebook and how our journey holding Facebook over the past three years has gone.

Cool, so that's adding a caption. Another way to customize your story is by customizing the layout. In the left panel here, there's a story panel, then there's a layout panel. We can edit the navigator style here, from caption boxes, to numbers where the caption are gone, to dots where the number are gone, and to arrows only. So the choice here really depends on preference, and the kind of story and the kind of context you're presenting your story. So if you want to have a less verbal, or a less textual story, you can click with the numbers navigator style, and you'd really emphasize the plots themselves if you want to minimize the text, and you can orate accordingly.
