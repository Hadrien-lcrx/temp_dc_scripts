We’ve connected to the Gapminder data source and we’re interested in learning which countries had the most cases of lung cancer. Before we dive into the process though, let’s take a quick look at the data pane. Here we have one geocoded dimension. This field is marked with a globe icon. When we drag Country from Dimensions into the view, two things happen. The first is that Tableau automatically adds the Country field to detail on the Marks card. The second is that Tableau generates the latitude and longitude fields on Columns and Rows since the Country field was geocoded for us. Before starting, let’s filter the data on the latest year in our dataset, 2008
Now that we’ve generated a map, let’s see which countries had the most lung cancer cases. First, we’ll drag Lung Cancer from Measures to Size on the Marks card. We can increase the size of the circles, so it’s easier to see which countries had the most cases. A symbol map is perfect here because the circles in our view standardize how the data is shown and you don’t get a biased view of lung cancer cases based on the relative size of the countries. Instead, you’re focussing on the size of each circle within each country. It’s important to note that Tableau will assign the smallest circle size to the lowest value and the largest circle size to the highest value. Everything in between is represented by a proportional size based on the actual lung cancer cases. So it’s not a good idea to put a measure with potentially negative values on Size because it’s not immediately clear whether a mark with a negative number is positive or negative. Over to you.
