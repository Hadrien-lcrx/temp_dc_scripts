In this demo and exercise series you'll learn to create stories. Tableau stories. So a story, again, is a sequence of visualizations that tell a story, and we are going to create a story with our stock worksheets, Facebook, Teso, TD, Toyota, as well as the currency and value worksheets, again value being the value of your entire portfolio in US dollars, your home currency. To create that Tableau story or any Tableau story in general, we click the New Story button here in the bottom. It's next to the New Worksheet and the New Dashboard button, and that is because a story is also a Sheet, like these two things are. So if we click New Story we get an empty story Sheet. At the same time a story is a collection of sheets, which is why our sheets here, Facebook, Tesco, TD, Toyota, are populated in the left panel. This should feel very similar to the dashboard interface, and that's a very nice thing Tableau has done for us. So, if we want to create a story with story points, we'll add them by double-clicking them. So, double-click Facebook, it pops up as a story point. Double-click Tesco: adds another story point. TD Bank. We can also create a story point by clicking Blank under New story point, dragging and dropping it over. I like double-clicking, it's a little quicker. So here is our six story points story, and we can progress through it by clicking the arrow button here. It's a little hard to interact with right now, so the way we would typically interact with it is in Presentation Mode, and this is how you would tell your story to your stakeholders. We haven't customized this story yet, we will do that a little later, but this is the gist of the interface.
