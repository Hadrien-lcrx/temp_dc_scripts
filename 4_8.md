All right, now you're going to learn how to share your work, a beautiful thing Tableau has made easy. So you already saved this workbook to your Tableau Public profile by clicking File, Save to Tableau Public while already signed into your profile, and to access and share that online visualization which is accessible by anyone on the Internet, you can click open your favorite browser, Chrome for example here, and go to your Tableau Public profile which you can search on a search engine, or go to public dot tableau dot com and sign in and access your profile, and your workbook will be available here to click on. I've called it portfolio. And clicking that, we can interact with our visualizations in the same way we would on our own computer. We've got tooltips and everything, we can change worksheets, TD Bank here for example, we can download the workbook, we can share it with the link here, copying and pasting that in an email for example, we can even embed it in our own personal website or a blog we contribute to.
