Once again we are connected to the UN Health data and this time we are interested in the monthly evolution of the number of deaths in Portugal over the past five years. Let’s start by building a line chart. We’ll do this as we've learned before. First, drag Date to Columns and Deaths to Rows, then go to the dropdown menu next to YEAR(Date) and select Month in the second section to ensure that it’s interpreted as continuous. Let’s also filter by dragging Country to the Filters shelve and selecting Portugal. Do the same for Years. We only keep the last five years and click OK. Great! Let’s take this line chart to the next level by adding a reference line indicating the average number of monthly deaths. To do this you need to go to the Analytics pane. Then, under Custom, you’ll see Reference Line. Drag this into the View. You’ll notice a grid with options appears. We want to apply the calculation across the entire table, the average over all months, and we want the average of the deaths measure. In the dialog box that opens you see that the default calculation is average so that’s perfect. Click OK. There we go. The reference line makes it really easy to compare how the number of Portuguese deaths compares to the average over time. Let’s give it a go!
