Let’s continue with our highlight table and start using some quick table calculations. Imagine that now we don’t want to know the absolute number of liver cancer cases in each country but are interested in the percent difference going from year to year. Meaning, by how many percents did the number of cancer cases change in 2007 compared to 2006, and in 2008 compared to 2007. In Tableau, it’s really easy and fast to calculate this if you make use of quick table calculations. Let’s first change the values in our table. To do this you need to right-click the second SUM(Liver Cancer) on the Marks card and select Quick Table Calculation, Percent Difference. Let’s do the same for the color. We right-click the first SUM(Liver Cancer) on the Marks card and select Quick Table Calculation, Percent Difference. Note that a delta symbol appears on the field to indicate that a quick table calculation is being applied to the field. By default, Tableau is going to apply the calculation from left to right for every row, which is what we want so that’s great. Let’s also show the original values as a reference point. We can do this by, once again, dragging Liver Cancer from Measures to Label on the Marks card. We can move the original value to be above the calculation simply by dragging it over there like this. Let’s look at the results. The first column is empty since we don’t have a year prior to 2006 to compare it with. In the second column, you see by how many percents the number of liver cancer cases changed from 2006. For Albania, for example, there were .5 percent fewer cases in 2007. Since we adjusted the color as well, it’s once again very easy to spot extreme values. Quick table calculations made this rather complex analysis really easy, now it’s up to you!
