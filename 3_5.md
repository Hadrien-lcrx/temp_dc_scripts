This time we’ve connected to a new dataset. This new data contains health statistics from the United Nations Statistics Division. Let’s first take a quick look at our data. If we click on View Data we’ll see that we have geographic data about the continent and country, number of deaths and births, and also a date variable. Combining all this we can create a visualization that gives us an idea of the evolution of births in a country over the years. If we go back to the sheet and look at the data pane you can see that the date dimension is marked with a calendar icon. To create the line chart we need to drag date to Columns and the measure Births to Rows. Let’s also filter by dragging Country to the Filters shelve and selecting Portugal. Notice how Tableau has automatically aggregated the data for every year. SO, there is a datapoint with the total number of births for every year and they are all connected through the line chart. This visualization gives us a good idea of the evolution of Portuguese births over the years. Let’s create a line chart!
