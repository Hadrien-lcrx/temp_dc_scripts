All right in this demo and exercise series, you'll learn how to use tooltips, how to adjust your axes as necessary, and how to add memorable titles.

So, using tooltips. The person interacting with your viz will intuitively hover over your data, here for example, Facebook price day of date, or Facebook shares day of date, and the information that appears in this tooltip is an excellent helper for conveying your data story.

Tableau again, bless them, adds tooltips by default for most views like they did here. But say you want to customize this tooltip, you could by clicking Tooltip in the Marks card, you can add a line that says "Goal: grow investments". And this will show up here. Great.

Next best practice: adjusting axes as necessary. By default, an axis range in Tableau will automatically adjust based on the data in your viz, for example, a hundred and twenty dollars to two hundred and twenty here for Facebook price. And that's great.

But say we wanted to make this x axis year instead of this month and then year. We can right click the axis or double click it, click Edit axis, and let's make the Tick Marks, Major Tick Marks, fixed, interval one year. Nice, that's a little better.

We can also do the same, or similar, by right clicking the Facebook price axis, and we'll actually change the label here instead: Facebook price, specifying that it's actually in US dollars. All right.

Finally, adding a memorable title. Clear, succinct titles give your reader a key takeaway, which is what usually sticks in their memory most according to dataviz research.

Tableau by default makes the name of this plot the name of the worksheet, Sheet One, which isn't very helpful, so we will change it to something a bit more captivating: "My investment in Facebook", if I can type properly, OK. And that looks much better.
